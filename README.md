# Matplotib-challenge

The process of the project Matplotib-challenge :


1.	Read the instructions, hits and considerations
2.	Impot the dependencies and the files 
3.	Open the csv file and analyse the data for both files and create a new csv file with all the information to have a better understanding of the project
4.	Combine the data in Jupiter. Then the result was saved in a csv file for a future analysis  
5.	Follow the instructions of the file checking the Pandas Documentation and Google during all my work
6.	Generate the graphs 
7.	First draft was pushed in GigHub. 
8.	After having a tutorial my tutor indicated that the clean DataFrame was wrong as I filter the data by the last point. I made the changes straight away 
9.	Calculating the final tumour volume was the hardest part. My initial interpretation was that the maximum timepoint for all mice was 45 so I had to go analyse and understand data. I realised that the last time was not only 45. So I had ato update my data and graphs.
10.	Read an article of how to use Markdown in Jupyter 
11.	Write the observations of the results 
12.	Write the process
